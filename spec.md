Specs:

 [x] Use Sinatra to build the app - speaks for itself!
 [x]  Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database - all models inherit from ActiveRecord
 [x]  Include more than one model class (list of model class names e.g. User, Post, Category) - models are Project and User
 [x]  Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y e.g. User has_many Posts) - Users have many Projects
 [x]  Include user accounts - done
 [x]  Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users - done
 [x] Include user input validations - validations are installed in controller in routes, sometimes double-stacked validations for extra security
 [x]  Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new) - displays message when user attempts to edit or delete other projects that don't belong to that user
 [x]  Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code
Confirm

 [x]  You have a large number of small Git commits - definitely got better at this as the project went on
 [x]  Your commit messages are meaningful - mostly better during the second half of programming
 [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
 [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message - as mentioned, much better at this in the second half of building this project
